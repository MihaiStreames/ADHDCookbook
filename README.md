# ADHD Cookbook

ADHD Cookbook is a mobile app I built to make cooking more manageable for myself and others with ADHD. After struggling
with overwhelming recipe websites and (sometimes) complicated instructions, I created this distraction-friendly cooking
app that breaks everything down into clear, manageable steps.

## Why I Made This

As someone with ADHD, cooking from traditional recipes is often frustrating:

- Getting lost in long paragraphs of instructions
- Forgetting where I left off when distracted
- Losing track of which ingredients I need for each step
- Getting overwhelmed by too much information at once

This app addresses all these issues by presenting cooking in an ADHD-friendly way:

- **One step at a time:** See only what you need to focus on now
- **Visual cues:** Photos for each step make instructions clearer
- **Ingredient linking:** Each step shows exactly which ingredients you need right now
- **Progress tracking:** Check off completed steps so you never lose your place
